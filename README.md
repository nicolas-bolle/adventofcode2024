Nick Bolle's solutions

Python 3.12.6

The most "lightweight" way to run solutions is to import solution functions and run them on inputs yourself:
- "from solutions.nickb_day1 import solution_part1, solution_part2"
- Obtain the input in a string s
- Run solution_part1(s) and solution_part2(s)

Or you can get fancy and
- Run a single python file (hit Run in VSCode, or do "python ./solutions/nickb_day1.py")
- Run the test file test_solutions.py to run all solutions and check they get the right answers
- Use the functions in test_solution.py to run specific dates

But to do the fancier way, you need to follow the instructions in /utils/inputs.py to set up the cookies.txt file (so the code can read inputs from the website).
